# Smartphone in CLI

This is a cool project I made to solve a challenge from a course in Java.

The main idea here is to produce the **Smart**phone structure, as mentioned by Steve Jobs in [iPhone 1 - Steve Jobs MacWorld keynote in 2007 - Full Presentation, 80 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKMoT-6XSg). The combination of a Web Browser, a Music Player and an conventional phone in one single device (in this case, one single App, I'd say).

There are certainly many improvements to be made here, especially in the phone part of things. Ideally, I'd use something such as Twillio to perform actions such as send SMSs, but I'm at the beggining of my java journey, so that's what I managed to do, considering that I have little to no knowledge about build tools in Java (that's going to change pretty soon).

Limitations in each front:

- **Web Browser**: only does GET request
- **Phone**: a very simple CLI, is just a scanner and a buch of `System.out.println` ðŸ˜…
- **Music Player**: it only accepts `.wav` files

References I used for this project (other than Stev Jobs presentation):

Hope you enjoy the code!!! ðŸ«¶
